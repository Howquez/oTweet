# oTweet 🐣

oTweet is an [oTree](https://www.otree.org/) app that aims to mimic twitter's Feed's interface & some of its interactions for user & consumer research.
Importantly, researchers can manipulate the feed in a matter of seconds: oTweet was designed such that one only has to change one .csv file to change the feed being displayed.

- Easy to **customize** as the content stems from a single [.csv file](otree/feed/static/tweets/sample_tweets.csv) which is easy to adjust.
- Measures **interactions** such as tweets, likes and replies.
- Visualizes not only tweets but also the corresponding **users' information.**
- Contains a column dedicated to **[ads](otree/feed/static/img/flatiron.png) or _'Trends for you'_**.
- Based on **oTree**, a popular open-source platform that is well documented.
- Uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/) (also well documented) to make the app **responsive**.
