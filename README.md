# oTweet üê£

oTweet is an [oTree](https://www.otree.org/) app that aims to mimic social media feeds' interfaces & some of the corresponding interactions for consumer research.
Importantly, researchers can manipulate a feed in a matter of seconds without writing code: oTweet was designed such that one only has to change one .csv file to change the feed being displayed.

- Easy to **customize** as the content stems from a single [.csv file](otree/Twitter/static/tweets/sample_tweets.csv) which is easy to adjust.
- Measures **interactions** such as tweets, likes and replies.
- Visualizes not only tweets but also the corresponding **users' information.**
- Contains a column dedicated to **[ads](otree/Twitter/static/img/flatiron.png) or _'Trends for you'_**.
- Based on **oTree**, a popular open-source platform that is well documented.
- Uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/) (also well documented) to make the app **responsive**.

**New:**
In addition to _Twitter_, oTweet also offers a _Linkedin_ app.
