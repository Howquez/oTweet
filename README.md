# oTweet

oTweet is an [oTree](https://www.otree.org/) app that aims to mimic twitter's Feed's interface & some of its interactions for user & consumer research.
Importantly, researchers can manipulate the feed in a matter of seconds: To make its use as simple as possible, oTweet was designed such that one only has to change one .csv file to change the displayed feed.
By using a well established and -documented open-source platform, I hope to encourage future researchers to adjust the app to their individual needs.
