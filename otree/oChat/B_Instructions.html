                        We will expose you a similar task as before.
                        More specifically, you will see screens on which you have to make a decision between two options.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-secondary">
                        As before, you will express your choice vocally.
                        Hence, we ask you again to say out loud, which option you choose.
                        Importantly, we require you to express your choice saying <em class="text-primary">'I choose ...'</em> again.
                        But this time, you make your own choices. Hence, you decide whether you prefer
                        <em class="text-primary">'X'</em> or
                        <em class="text-primary">'Y'</em>.

                        Note that you will not be able to listen to your recording,
                        and you will only have one take to record your choice.
                        Also note that the recording will start automatically.

                                    Stage II is the main part of the study in which you have to make a series of short
                                    decisions: You will see several pages showing two options and you say out loud
                                    which of these two options you prefer.
                                </li>

                             In both stages, your microphone will automatically start recording at the start of every page.
                             Your task is to first decide (i.e., say out loud) which option to choose and then click on
                             the button on the bottom of the page saying “Stop Recording”.

                            In Stage I, there will be the option to listen to your voice recording again.
                            You can re-record yourself in this first stage as often as you wish.
                            This stage serves the purpose to make sure your audio is recorded properly.
                            Please make sure (and listen to) your recording to ensure a high quality recording without background noise.

                            In Stage II, the recording starts automatically again (as in the first stage) but you
                            will <u>NOT</u> have the option to listen to your recording again.
                            In sum, please follow the following steps.
