After the first session on the joint Roche/HBS case study, we had a fruitful discussion about the five Future of Finance theses and received insightful feedback on Roche’s Finance Strategy and the way forward. I'm inspired and excited about the future and how Roche will continue to execute our strategy.

Thank you very much for the very valuable thoughts and dialogue. What a great experience!
